[progress_notification]
#percent: 0
#	This is an interval in percent, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5, notifications are sent at 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.
#	When set to 3, notifications are sent at 3%, 6%, 9%, etc.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print percentage.
#	This value should be an integer >=0.
#height: 0.0
#	This is an interval in mm, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5.0, notifications are sent at 5.0mm, 10.0mm, 15.0mm, etc, print height.
#	When set to 0.25, notifications are sent at 0.25mm, 0.5mm, 0.75mm, etc, print height.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print height.
#	This value should be an float >=0.0.
#time: 0
#	This is the recommended way to use progress notifications.
#	This is an interval in seconds, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 600, notifications are sent at 600 seconds, 1200 seconds, 1800 seconds, etc, print time.
#	When set to 100, notifications are sent at 100 seconds, 200 seconds, 300 seconds, etc, print time.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on time.
#	This type of notifications continues, even when the print is paused. So if your printer triggers a pause, for example 
#	caused by filament runout, you will still get notifications regularly, until the print is completed/canceled.  
#	This value should be an integer >=0.
#groups: group_id_1, group_id_2
#	When running multiple printers/a farm, you may want to aggregate all notifications from all printers in a group.
#	You can enter group IDs here, to which notifications will be sent. No control from a group is possible.
#	Only notifications are sent.
#	This should be a list of integers.
#group_only: false
#	If you are using the group feature, you might want to disable individual notifications and use group notifications only.
#	Set this to true to disable individual notifications in individual chats.
#	This value should be boolean.
